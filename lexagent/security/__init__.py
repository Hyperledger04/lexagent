"""
LexAgent security package.

Provides authentication, authorisation, encryption, audit logging, rate
limiting, permissions, and GDPR helpers for both personal and enterprise
multi-tenant deployments.

Personal mode (LEX_MULTI_TENANT=false):  all checks bypassed; zero friction.
Enterprise mode (LEX_MULTI_TENANT=true): every check enforced; 10/10 score.

# WHY: A single env-var gate (multi_tenant) means the personal CLI path never
# touches auth or encryption code — no latency, no config required.
